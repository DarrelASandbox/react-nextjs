## Why NextJS

- The React Framework for Production
- **Key Features:**
  - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
    - Automatic page pre-rendering: Great for SEO and initial load
    - Blending client-side and server-side: Fetch data on the server and render finished pages
  - **File-Based Routing**
    - Define pages and routes with files and folders instead of code
    - Less code, less work, highly understandable
  - **Fullstack Capabilities**
    - Easily add backend (server-side) code to your Next/ React apps
    - Storing data, getting data, authentication etc. can be added to your React projects

### Page Pre-Rendering & Data Fetching

![page-pre-rendering](diagrams/page-pre-rendering.png)

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
  - Pre-generation a page (with data prepared on the server-side) during build time
  - Pages are prepared ahead to time and can be cached by the server/ CDN serving the app
  - `export async function getStaticProps(context){...}`
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**
  - Pre-generate Page
  - Re-generate it on every request, at most every X seconds
    - Serve "old" page if re-generation is not needed yet
    - Generate, store and serve "new" page otherwise
  - `export async function getStaticPaths(){...}`
- **Server Side Rendering (SSR)**
  - Pre-render for every request
  - Need to access to the request object (e.g. cookies)
  - `export async function getServerSideProps(){...}`
