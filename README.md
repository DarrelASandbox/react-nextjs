## Notes

- The React Framework for Production
- **Key Features:**
  - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
    - Automatic page pre-rendering: Great for SEO and initial load
    - Blending client-side and server-side: Fetch data on the server and render finished pages
  - **File-Based Routing**
    - Define pages and routes with files and folders instead of code
    - Less code, less work, highly understandable
  - **Fullstack Capabilities**
    - Easily add backend (server-side) code to your Next/ React apps
    - Storing data, getting data, authentication etc. can be added to your React projects
